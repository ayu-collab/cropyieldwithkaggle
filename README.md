The output summarizes how well your model predicted the crop yield:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1820.53

On average, the predicted crop yields are off by 1820 units from the actual values. It gives a straightforward idea of the typical prediction error.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 7,021,429.51

MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily by squaring them, meaning large prediction errors affect this metric significantly. A high value suggests the model might struggle with certain data points.
The goal is to reduce these metrics through better models or data.
